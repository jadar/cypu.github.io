        short: "Fall Ministry is an opportunity for youth to fellowship with others and serve the church in exciting, practical ways."
        long: "Every year, high school-aged youth from around the presbytery are invited to the Fall Ministry Project–an event where the youth are able to serve the presbytery’s churches by helping with many different projects. The event begins on a Friday evening with a message from a guest speaker. Later on in the night, the youth are divided into various teams to be sent off to different churches throughout the presbytery. The following day, these teams will travel out to these congregations and aid them in various service projects, in addition to participating in any fun activities that the church may have planned. The youth then have an opportunity to worship with that congregation on Sunday morning before returning back to Second Reformed Presbyterian Church for pickup Sunday afternoon. We hope to see you there!"
