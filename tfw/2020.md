### TFW is a weekend of intensive theological study and fellowship for high school students.

The retreat aims to solidify the student’s understanding of and commitment to the doctrines and distinctive principles of the RPCNA. Because TFW is designed for upperclassmen, we also hope to strengthen their theological foundation in readiness for college and the workplace. We also want to encourage students toward enthusiasm for the ministries of the RPCNA as the sphere of their future service to Christ and His kingdom. Through this event, students will be able to participate in vibrant fellowship with fellow Christian youth around the study of God’s Word.
